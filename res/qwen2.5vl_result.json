This finding correlates with your mother's symptoms of persistent dizziness and blurred vision, as these neurological deficits can be caused by damage to specific regions of the brain responsible for balance and visual processing.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that your mother may have suffered from a recent ischemic event affecting the right frontoparietal region of her brain. The lack of significant mass effect suggests that there hasn't been extensive swelling or bleeding associated with the stroke at this stage.\n\nTo further evaluate",
